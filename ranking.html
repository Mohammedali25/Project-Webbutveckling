    <p>Want to rise through the CS:GO ranks? You've spent more hours than you want to admit grinding through matches in Counter-Strike's competitive mode, but no one really knows exactly how the system works. While we continue to fret over our ranks and win rates, Valve isn't giving anything away.

        You'll need to invest more time in aim training if you're eager to improve. I also recommend practicing your smoke grenade placements, and learning the best strategies for your favourite maps. Unfortunately, CS:GO's ranking system is not an exact science, but I've managed to dig out information from the most reliable sources (including Valve) to give you a better idea of how it works. I'm here to walk you through what the CS:GO ranks are, explain MMR decay, and help you break into the next rank bracket.
        </p>
        <h1>CS:GO ranks </h1>
        <p> Here are all the CS:GO ranks, from the lowest to highest competitive skill groups </p>
        
       
        <p> Silver I </p>
        <p>Silver II </p>
        <p>Silver III </p>
        <p>Silver IV </p>
        <p>Silver  </p>
        <p>Silver Elite Master </p>
        <p> Gold Nova I </p> 
        <p>Gold Nova II</p>
        <p>Gold Nova III</p>
        <p> Gold Nova Master</p>
        <p> Master Guardian I</p>
        <p>Master Guardian II</p>
        <p>Master Guardian Elite</p>
        <p>Distinguished Master Guardian</p>
        <p>Legendary Eagle</p>
        <p> Legendary Eagle Master</p>
        <p>Supreme Master First Class</p>
        <p>The Global Elite</p>
        <h1>How CS:GO ranks work </h1>
        <p>To earn your initial rank, you'll have to win ten placement matches, at a limit of two per day. These allow time for the game’s ranking system to determine your caliber. Note that an unranked player will be unable to queue with anyone of rank Master Guardian II or higher, unless queuing with a full team of five.
        
        Once you've earned those ten wins you’ll be assigned into one of 18 skill groups, depending on your performance. You’ll now be able to play as many matches as you like, but can only queue with players within five ranks higher or lower of your own (once again, excluding a premade team of five).
        
        Based on successes and failures, your rank will be adjusted at the end of each match, assigning you a higher or lower skill group, if necessary. The mechanics behind this are still unclear, but the surest way to improve is by winning as a team.
        
        Play no matches for a month and your skill group will disappear, requiring a win or draw to return it. Again, you’ll no longer be able to play with ranks above Master Guardian I until you’ve earned it back.
