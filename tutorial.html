    <p>1. Start by choosing the map you would like to play on, i personally reccomend dust 2 as it is the easiest to learn quick.</p> 
    <p>2. As you get into a game there will be different rounds, the first round u will only have a pistol and 800$ but get more money every round buy the gun that you think would be the best, i reccomend the ak-47 as a terrorist or the m4a1-s as the counter terrorist.</p>
    <p>3. Now the round start, if you are the terrorist your mission is to either plan the bomb and wait for the timer to run out or kill the entire enemy, if youre playing as counter terrorist you need to defuse the bomb the terrorist plant or kill the entire enemy team before they plant.</p>
    <p>4. As a counter-terrorist or ct for short you shouldnt forget to buy a defuse kit when you can afford it, they make it so it takes 5 seconds (instead of the normal 10 seconds) to defuse a bomb which could be the reason you win the round.</p>
    <p>5. Don't forget to buy utilities/grenades they can be the reason you win certain games for example a grenade could clear a corner for you or a molotov could make it so they can't push from a certain angle so you only have one angle to hold.</p>
